- wrap SKU in special value type
	- greater complication? But also makes for best representation of the domain - less information hiding in consuming code

- prices to be decided by strategy pattern - each strategy is a multibuy offer. Strategies will attempt to reduce number down to zero, accumulating total price.
	- this will happen in a pricing service; outside of this service, we just deal with a bag of SKUs
	
- Items have to be ordered before the strategies get to them - put this in the service probably, its part of pricing mechanism
