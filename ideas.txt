- wrap SKU in special value type
	- greater complication? But also makes for best representation of the domain - less information hiding in consuming code

- prices to be decided by strategy pattern - each strategy is a multibuy offer. Strategies will attempt to reduce number down to zero, accumulating total price.
	- this will happen in a pricing service; outside of this service, we just deal with a bag of SKUs
	
- Items have to be ordered before the strategies get to them - put this in the service probably, its part of pricing mechanism

-------------

Pricing strategies won't necessarily relate to single products only - each strategy must be let loose on the entire list of
SKUs to decide whether it applies or not. Bottom priority would be simple SingleItemOffer, one for each SKU. In the middle 
would be MultiItemOffer, which would take items of a single type but in variable quantities. 

So we can proceed by supporting simple strategies first, and then moving outwards.
